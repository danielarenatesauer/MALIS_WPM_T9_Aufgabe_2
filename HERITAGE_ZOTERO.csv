Was „einfach“ oder „intuitiv“ ist, hängt dabei von der Nutzungssituation und der Zielgruppe ab. Usability wird nicht am Ende eines Projektes auf eine Webseite oder Software aufgetragen – Usability kann nur gelingen, wenn sie in allen Projektphasen und von allen Beteiligten ernstgenommen wird. Das Buch „User – Interface – Design“ beschreibt nicht nur die Ansprüche an eine gute Nutzer-Schnittstelle, sondern bietet einen Überblick und Einstieg in alle Aspekte des Interface-Design: von Geschichte über Design-Grundlagen und Standard-Elemente bis zu ISO- und DIN-Normen. Ein umfangreiches Glossar erläutert die Fachbegriffe, und zahlreiche Checklisten unterstützen bei der Umsetzung im Alltag.

Oft wird bei der Entwicklung und beim Design von Soft- und Hardware zu wenig an den Menschen als Benutzer gedacht. Im vorliegenden Buch wird umfassend in das komplexe Fachgebiet der Benutzerfreundlichkeit, das sogenannte 'Usability Engineering» eingeführt. Es werden die Evaluationsmethoden neuer Soft- und Hardware beschrieben und anhand von Beispielen aus der Praxis vorgeführt. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf den Methoden, mit denen Prototypen oder auch fertige Systeme hinsichtlich ihrer Gebrauchstauglichkeit beurteilt werden können. Weiterhin wird gezeigt, wie die Einführung und Gestaltung von Computersystemen die Arbeit der Menschen beeinflusst und ganze Organisationen verändern kann. Alle, die sich praktisch mit dem Bereich des 'Usability Engineering» auseinandersetzen, können mit diesem Buch ihr Methodenrepertoire erweitern bzw. die geeignete Methode für die verschiedensten Projekte ermitteln. Es eignet sich aber auch für alle, die sich mit Arbeitsgestaltung und Organisationsentwicklung beschäftigen sowie für Informatiker oder Mediendesigner, die sich für Soft- und Hardwareentwicklung interessieren.

The macro-level measuring instruments consisted of 26 evaluation criteria with the following broad categories: content, access, services, interface, searching, search results, cost, citation and analytical tools, and linking abilities. The micro-level measuring instrument’s evaluation criteria represented the data fields of the journal records to establish comprehensivity. The macro-level evaluation results indicated that Scopus surpassed both WOS and GS whereas the micro-level evaluation results indicated that WOS surpassed both Scopus and GS. Based on the macro- and micro-level evaluation results the study was able to establish that GS is not yet a substitute but rather a supplementary citation resource for the fee-based WOS and/or Scopus for the South African international accredited scholarly environmental sciences journals during the period 2004-2008.","","2019-06-04 11:20:39","2019-06-04 11:25:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peer review is the oldest form of monitoring the scientific process and research outcomes and is sometimes considered as the gold standard for evaluating quality. However, it also has its drawbacks; therefore, new forms of peer review are being explored. Bibliometrics, comparative statistics based on publication and citation counts, was introduced as a more objective evaluation method, which is applicable on meso and macro levels of research producing units but is not without problems either. Citation counts as a proxy of quality; the impact factor and the h-index are some of the most controversial subjects of research evaluation today. The newest addition to the evaluation toolbox are altmetrics, impact measures based mainly on social media activity. Altmetrics have pros and cons as well. None of the measuring devices is perfect, and rather than replacing they complement each other. By drawing on indicators from all three aspects of research evaluation, negative and adverse effects are limited.","2018","2019-06-15 06:56:05","2019-06-15 06:56:05","2019-06-15 06:56:05","653-656","","1","55","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2018 by Association for Information Science and Technology","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/ABAJ52PU/pra2.2018.html","","","altmetrics; bibliometrics; Peer review; research evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die Organisationstheorie hat nachgewiesen, dass bürokratische Großunternehmen ebenso Wandel behindern wie zu starke Unternehmenskulturen.

But what does such a culture look like? Research from international and political relations has demonstrated that the level of integrative complexity (IC) as disseminated in political messages is an important factor in the context of conflict management. In our research, we hypothesize that, similar to political messages, corporate communication, which emphasizes a complex (i.e., differentiated and integrated) way of understanding multidimensional issues, is connected to cooperative conflict management and related variables like perceptions of organizational justice. Results of a multilevel field study support this proposition. Whereas the level of organizational IC was assessed by rating organizations’ communication (specifically their vision or mission statements published on the Internet), perceptions of conflict management and justice were assessed by asking employees. The study emphasizes the utility of addressing organizational level variables in relation to organizational members’ perceptions.","2014","2019-06-23 10:05:20","2019-06-23 10:05:20","2019-06-23 10:05:19","265-281","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/PUBBVY68/Kugler and Brodbeck - 2014 - Corporate Communication and Worker Perceptions of .pdf; /Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/K6YRLKHP/ncmr.html","","","conflict management; corporate communication; integrative complexity; organizational justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study begins with Background of the study Eugene Garfield first outlined the idea of a unified citation index to the literature of science in 1955. “Citation indexes resolve semantic problems associated with traditional subject indexes by using citation symbology rather than words to describe the content of a document ” (Weinstock 1971). Eugene Garfield’s main purpose in proposing the construction of a citation index for science, in which the references in scientific articles are used as index terms, was for the citation index to function as an information retrieval tool for scientific information (Garfield 1955). The rationale behind this kind of indexing is to exploit what Garfield calls the “association-of-ideas ” or “Citations are the formal, explicit linkages between papers that have particular points in common ” (Garfield 1979, 1). Soon after the beginning of the World Wide Web, the literature available on the Web increased very rapidly. The growing amount of literature on the Web and the need for multidisciplinary information retrieval accentuated the need for improved retrieval methods because while the documents were readily available, locating them","2005","2019-06-30 14:34:55","2019-06-30 14:34:55","","170–180","","","55","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/53A2QRKY/Noruzi - 2005 - Google Scholar The new generation of citation ind.pdf; /Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/UKW2XYMK/summary.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine to what extent citation data from the two databases reflect the scholarly impact of women and men differently. Our conjecture is that WoS carries an indirect gender bias in its selection criteria for citation sources that GS avoids due to criteria that are more inclusive. Using a sample of 1250 U.S. researchers in Sociology, Political Science, Economics, Cardiology and Chemistry, we examine gender differences in the average citation coverage of the two databases. We also calculate database-specific h-indices for all authors in the sample. In repeated simulations of hiring scenarios, we use these indices to examine whether women's appointment rates increase if hiring decisions rely on data from GS in lieu of WoS. We find no systematic gender differences in the citation coverage of the two databases. Further, our results indicate marginal to non-existing effects of database selection on women's success-rates in the simulations. In line with the existing literature, we find the citation coverage in WoS to be largest in Cardiology and Chemistry and smallest in Political Science and Sociology. The concordance between author-based h-indices measured by GS and WoS is largest for Chemistry followed by Cardiology, Political Science, Sociology and Economics.","2018-08-01","2019-07-01 11:15:53","2019-07-01 11:15:53","2019-07-01 11:15:53","950-959","","3","12","","Journal of Informetrics","Google Scholar and Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/DJZG3FKJ/S1751157718300282.html","","","-Index; Academic careers; Gender in research; Google Scholar; Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study shows deficiencies in the coverage and up-to-dateness of the Google Scholar index. Furthermore, the study points up which web servers are the most important data providers for this search service and which information sources are represented. We conclude that Google Scholar has some interesting potentials (e.g. citation analysis, free materials) but can not be seen as a substitute for the use of special literature databases due to a couple of weaknesses (e.g. transparency).","2006","2019-07-02 07:50:02","2019-07-02 07:50:02","2019-07-02 07:50:03","241-262","","","Tagung","","","Google Scholar – wie tief gräbt diese Suchmaschine?","","","","","Informationszentrum Sozialwissenschaften","","en","","","","","eprints.rclis.org","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/XRQGL2VB/Mayr and Walter - 2006 - Google Scholar – wie tief gräbt diese Suchmaschine.pdf; /Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/4B2DGDTV/8138.html","","","","Stempfhuber, Maximilian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comparing the sizes of 12 academic search engines and bibliographic databases","Scientometrics","","1588-2861","10.1007/s11192-018-2958-5","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2958-5","Information on the size of academic search engines and bibliographic databases (ASEBDs) is often outdated or entirely unavailable. Hence, it is difficult to assess the scope of specific databases, such as Google Scholar. While scientometric studies have estimated ASEBD sizes before, the methods employed were able to compare only a few databases. Consequently, there is no up-to-date comparative information on the sizes of popular ASEBDs. This study aims to fill this blind spot by providing a comparative picture of 12 of the most commonly used ASEBDs. In doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. Iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most ASEBDs. The results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. The queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly. The findings provide first-time size estimates of ProQuest and EbscoHost and indicate that Google Scholar’s size might have been underestimated so far by more than 50%. By our estimation Google Scholar, with 389 million records, is currently the most comprehensive academic search engine.","2019-01-01","2019-07-02 08:43:12","2019-07-02 08:43:12","2019-07-02 08:43:12","177-214","","1","118","","Scientometrics","Google Scholar to overshadow them all?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/ADAJ8L4S/Gusenbauer - 2019 - Google Scholar to overshadow them all Comparing t.pdf","","","Google Scholar; Academic bibliographic database; Academic search engine; Iterative analysis; Metrics; Query hit count; Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies comparing GS to controlled databases such as Scopus, Web of Science (WOS) and others have been published almost since GS inception. These studies focus on its coverage, quality and ability to replace controlled databases as a source of reliable scientific literature. In addition, GS introduction of citations tracking and journal metrics have spurred a body of literature focusing on its ability to produce reliable metrics. In this article we aimed to review some studies in these areas in an effort to provide insights into GS ability to replace controlled databases in various subject areas. We reviewed 91 comparative articles from 2005 until 2016 which compared GS to various databases and especially Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus in an effort to determine whether GS can be used as a suitable source of scientific information and as a source of data for scientific evaluation. Our results show that GS has significantly expanded its coverage through the years which makes it a powerful database of scholarly literature. However, the quality of resources indexed and overall policy still remains known. Caution should be exercised when relying on GS for citations and metrics mainly because it can be easily manipulated and its indexing quality still remains a challenge.","2017-08-01","2019-07-02 08:59:09","2019-07-02 08:59:09","2019-07-02 08:59:09","823-834","","3","11","","Journal of Informetrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/YDG54ZDT/S1751157717300676.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It focuses on the coverage and citation impact of sources, indexing speed, and data quality, including the effect of duplicate citation counts. The method compares GS with Elsevier’s Scopus, and is applied to a limited set of articles published in 12 journals from six subject fields, so that its findings cannot be generalized to all journals or fields. The study is exploratory, and hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis-testing. It confirms findings on source coverage and citation impact obtained in earlier studies. The ratio of GS over Scopus citation varies across subject fields between 1.0 and 4.0, while Open Access journals in the sample show higher ratios than their non-OA counterparts. The linear correlation between GS and Scopus citation counts at the article level is high: Pearson’s R is in the range of 0.8-0.9. A median Scopus indexing delay of two months compared to GS is largely though not exclusively due to missing cited references in articles in press in Scopus. The effect of double citation counts in GS due to multiple citations with identical or substantially similar meta-data occurs in less than 2 per cent of cases. Pros and cons of article-based and what is termed as concept-based citation indexes are discussed.","2016-05","2019-07-02 09:00:26","2019-07-02 09:00:27","2019-07-02 09:00:26","533-551","","2","10","","Journal of Informetrics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/LDJCTEG5/Moed et al. - 2016 - A new methodology for comparing Google Scholar and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
