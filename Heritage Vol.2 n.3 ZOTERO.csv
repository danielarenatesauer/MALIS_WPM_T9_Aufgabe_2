The purpose of this study was to shed light on the types of issues that employees are reluctant to raise, and identify why employees sometimes decide to remain silent rather than voice their concerns. We interviewed 40 employees and found that most had been in situations where they were concerned about an issue but did not raise it to a supervisor. Silence spanned a range of organizational issues, with several of our respondents indicating that they did not feel comfortable speaking to those above them about any issues or concerns. The most frequently mentioned reason for remaining silent was the fear of being viewed or labeled negatively, and as a consequence, damaging valued relationships. From our data, we develop a model of how the perceived consequences of voice contribute to silence, and a model of how the social and relational implications of speaking up can take away employees? ability to have influence within an organizational setting.","2003-09-01","2019-06-23 18:40:08","2019-06-23 18:40:08","2019-06-23 18:40:08","1453-1476","","6","40","","Journal of Management Studies","An Exploratory Study of Employee Silence","","","","","","","","","","","","onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/IWCEIEHA/1467-6486.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important feature of Google Scholar is that researchers can use it to trace interconnections among authors citing articles on the same topic and to determine the frequency with which others cite a specific article, as it has a “cited by &quot; feature. This study begins with Background of the study Eugene Garfield first outlined the idea of a unified citation index to the literature of science in 1955. “Citation indexes resolve semantic problems associated with traditional subject indexes by using citation symbology rather than words to describe the content of a document ” (Weinstock 1971). Eugene Garfield’s main purpose in proposing the construction of a citation index for science, in which the references in scientific articles are used as index terms, was for the citation index to function as an information retrieval tool for scientific information (Garfield 1955). The rationale behind this kind of indexing is to exploit what Garfield calls the “association-of-ideas ” or “Citations are the formal, explicit linkages between papers that have particular points in common ” (Garfield 1979, 1). Soon after the beginning of the World Wide Web, the literature available on the Web increased very rapidly. The growing amount of literature on the Web and the need for multidisciplinary information retrieval accentuated the need for improved retrieval methods because while the documents were readily available, locating them","2005","2019-06-30 14:34:55","2019-06-30 14:34:55","","170–180","","","55","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","","","","","","","CiteSeer","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/53A2QRKY/Noruzi - 2005 - Google Scholar The new generation of citation ind.pdf; /Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/UKW2XYMK/summary.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examine to what extent citation data from the two databases reflect the scholarly impact of women and men differently. Our conjecture is that WoS carries an indirect gender bias in its selection criteria for citation sources that GS avoids due to criteria that are more inclusive. Using a sample of 1250 U.S. researchers in Sociology, Political Science, Economics, Cardiology and Chemistry, we examine gender differences in the average citation coverage of the two databases. We also calculate database-specific h-indices for all authors in the sample. In repeated simulations of hiring scenarios, we use these indices to examine whether women's appointment rates increase if hiring decisions rely on data from GS in lieu of WoS. We find no systematic gender differences in the citation coverage of the two databases. Further, our results indicate marginal to non-existing effects of database selection on women's success-rates in the simulations. In line with the existing literature, we find the citation coverage in WoS to be largest in Cardiology and Chemistry and smallest in Political Science and Sociology. The concordance between author-based h-indices measured by GS and WoS is largest for Chemistry followed by Cardiology, Political Science, Sociology and Economics.","2018-08-01","2019-07-01 11:15:53","2019-07-01 11:15:53","2019-07-01 11:15:53","950-959","","3","12","","Journal of Informetrics","Google Scholar and Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/DJZG3FKJ/S1751157718300282.html","","","-Index; Academic careers; Gender in research; Google Scholar; Web of Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, it is difficult to assess the scope of specific databases, such as Google Scholar. While scientometric studies have estimated ASEBD sizes before, the methods employed were able to compare only a few databases. Consequently, there is no up-to-date comparative information on the sizes of popular ASEBDs. This study aims to fill this blind spot by providing a comparative picture of 12 of the most commonly used ASEBDs. In doing so, we build on and refine previous scientometric research by counting query hit data as an indicator of the number of accessible records. Iterative query optimization makes it possible to identify a maximum number of hits for most ASEBDs. The results were validated in terms of their capacity to assess database size by comparing them with official information on database sizes or previous scientometric studies. The queries used here are replicable, so size information can be updated quickly. The findings provide first-time size estimates of ProQuest and EbscoHost and indicate that Google Scholar’s size might have been underestimated so far by more than 50%.

In addition, GS introduction of citations tracking and journal metrics have spurred a body of literature focusing on its ability to produce reliable metrics. In this article we aimed to review some studies in these areas in an effort to provide insights into GS ability to replace controlled databases in various subject areas. We reviewed 91 comparative articles from 2005 until 2016 which compared GS to various databases and especially Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus in an effort to determine whether GS can be used as a suitable source of scientific information and as a source of data for scientific evaluation. Our results show that GS has significantly expanded its coverage through the years which makes it a powerful database of scholarly literature. However, the quality of resources indexed and overall policy still remains known.

It focuses on the coverage and citation impact of sources, indexing speed, and data quality, including the effect of duplicate citation counts. The method compares GS with Elsevier’s Scopus, and is applied to a limited set of articles published in 12 journals from six subject fields, so that its findings cannot be generalized to all journals or fields. The study is exploratory, and hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis-testing. It confirms findings on source coverage and citation impact obtained in earlier studies. The ratio of GS over Scopus citation varies across subject fields between 1.0 and 4.0, while Open Access journals in the sample show higher ratios than their non-OA counterparts. The linear correlation between GS and Scopus citation counts at the article level is high: Pearson’s R is in the range of 0.8-0.9. A median Scopus indexing delay of two months compared to GS is largely though not exclusively due to missing cited references in articles in press in Scopus. The effect of double citation counts in GS due to multiple citations with identical or substantially similar meta-data occurs in less than 2 per cent of cases. Pros and cons of article-based and what is termed as concept-based citation indexes are discussed.","2016-05","2019-07-02 09:00:26","2019-07-02 09:00:27","2019-07-02 09:00:26","533-551","","2","10","","Journal of Informetrics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/Mami/Zotero/storage/LDJCTEG5/Moed et al. - 2016 - A new methodology for comparing Google Scholar and.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
